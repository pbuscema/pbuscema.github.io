You're getting older, and there are such few boys. 

My mother tells me this in the mornings over FaceTime, brow furrowed,
washing all the dishes. Sometimes, her voice breaks.

She says I shouldn't be living alone, with no one to care for me when
I get into one of my moods, or have a cold. It gets dark, too, so early, 
she says. 

You're getting older, and there are such few boys.

Ammi, you've always been so soft. Smiling wide and almost smacking 
your lips when you tell me stories of the prophets, of how God graced 
them, how evil was undone. 

In Greenwich Village there are satans, you say. Men who practice witch-craft
and mix alcohol into your water. 

There was a night when we could not find you, and I knew someone had tied 
knots in your hair. It was so cold that night, and we found you at last in Roosevelt
Island, dancing on the rocks. You laughed and laughed, said you would feed all the 
fish in the river. Who, now, will marry you?

You're getting older, and there are such few boys.
