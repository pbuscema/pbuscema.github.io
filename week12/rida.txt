Aleppo

The bombs were falling down
and they were too loud
The kids covered their ears
and tried to get around

The little girl raced home in confusion and despair
She flung the front door open, 
only to see that her mother was not there

She looked at the table and there were the plates
Just like her mom left it, 
the dinner patiently waits

But nobody in her family would live to know the taste
Her home was in flames, 
and she was too late
