              <li>While doing this, af Klint created drawings in which the control was given to the unconscious mind and invented a geometric visual language, in 1896. </li>
              <li>Quote from Notebook: “The pictures were painted directly through me, without any preliminary drawings, and with great force. I had no idea what the paintings were supposed to depict; nevertheless I worked swiftly and surely, without changing a single brush stroke.”</li>
              <li>After working on her countless abstract work and the spiritual work, af Klint never showed her work during her lifetime.</li>
              <li>Although there were about 1200 paintings and drawings and 150 notebooks, she did not show them because she thought it was not time for the world to see them at the time.</li>
              <li>af Klint died in 1944 at 82 years old, in Djursholm, Sweden, of the aftermath of a traffic accident.</li>
              <li>As described in her will, af Klint left her abstract paintings to her nephew (Erif af Klint), and was told to not be opened for another 20 years.</li>
              <li>Erik af Klint donated the drawings and paintings to the Hilma af Klint Foundation in the 1970s.</li>
